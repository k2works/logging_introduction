{"name":"kibana","description":"Installs/Configures kibana","long_description":"kibana Cookbook\n===============\n\nA stand-alone cookbook for Kibana3.\n\nThis is a library cookbook,  you can use you included `kibana::install` recipe to install kibana, or you can call the LWRPs directly.\n\nIf you are upgrading from the previous (< 1.3) cookbook you can set `node['kibana']['legacy_mode'] = true` which should continue working.   This will be removed at some point and you'll be expected to use it as a library cookbook.\n\nThis cookbook is tested and works well with the `logstash` and the `elasticsearch` cookbooks found on the chef community site.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n- apt\n- yum\n- apache2\n- nginx\n- git\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\nAs with most cookbooks I write, this one is hopefully flexible enough to be wrapped by allowing you to override as much as possible\n\nSee `attributes/*.rb` for attributes ( documented inline )\n\nUsage\n-----\n#### kibana::default\n\nThe default recipe does nothing except for allow access to the LWRPs unless `legacy_mode` is turned on in which case it attempts to install kibana\nin the old fashioned way.\n\n#### kibana::install\n\nThis is designed to be an example recipe to show you how you might write a wrapper cookbook.   However it should be usable for a \nsimple install of kibana.\n\n- install kibana3 from `master` into `/opt/kibana/master` and create a symlink called `current` in the same directory to `master`\n- install `nginx` and serve the kibana application\n\nIf you wish to swap `apache` for `nginx`, simply set `node['kibana']['webserver']` to `apache` in a role/environment/node somewhere.\n\nIf you don't want this cookbook to handle the webserver config simply set `node['kibana']['webserver']` to `''` in a role/environment/node somewhere.\nPlease note that in this case you have to set `node['kibana']['user']`.\n\nBoth cookbooks, by default, will configure the appropriate proxy to your ElasticSearch server such that you don't have to expose it to the world.\n\n**NOTE**\nThere is **NO** security enabled by default on any of the content being served.\nIf you would like to modify the `nginx` or `apache` parameters, you should:\n\n- create your own cookbook i.e. `my-kibana`\n- copy the template for the webserver you wish to use to your cookbook\n- modify the template as you see fit (add auth, setup ssl)\n- use the appropriate webserver template attributes to point to your cookbook and template\n\n#### kibana::examples\n\nexamples of using the LWRPs.  Don't use this directly.\n\nTesting\n-------\n#### kitchen\n\n\n```\n$ bundle install\n$ bundle exec berks install\n$ bundle exec rake style spec # spec and style checks\n$ bundle exec rake kitchen # integration testing\n```\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n- Fork the repository on Github\n- Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)\n- Write you change\n- Write tests for your change (if applicable)\n- Run the tests, ensuring they all pass\n-- `bundle exec strainer test`\n- Submit a Pull Request using Github\n\nLicense and Authors\n-------------------\nPrimary authors:\n\n- John E.
